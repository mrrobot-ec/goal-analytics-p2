# Goal Analytics

## Overview

This project aims to uncover valuable insights into player combinations and patterns in soccer 
matches using the Apriori algorithm. The project focuses on identifying frequent player combinations and association 
rules to understand player co-occurrences and strategic patterns. This analysis is beneficial for soccer clubs, coaches, 
and analysts seeking to optimize team composition and strategic decision-making.

## Project Focus

The primary objectives of this project include:

- Identifying frequent player combinations in soccer matches.
- Analyzing association rules to understand player co-occurrences and strategic relationships.
- Extracting insights to optimize team composition and strategy.
- Providing actionable recommendations for coaches and analysts.

## Dataset

- **Source:** The dataset consists of match records containing player names, match dates, results, and scores.
- **Format:** CSV (Comma-Separated Values)
- **Contents:** Each row represents a match, including the date, players involved, match result, and score.

## Data Preprocessing

The preprocessing steps for this project involve:

1. Parsing the CSV file to extract match data.
2. Cleaning and transforming the data to prepare it for Apriori analysis.
3. Handling missing values and encoding player names into binary format.

## Analysis Techniques

- **Apriori Algorithm:** Used to identify frequent itemsets (player combinations) and association rules from the match data.
- **Visualization:** Utilized to present the results in an interpretable format, including scatter plots, bar charts, and network graphs.
